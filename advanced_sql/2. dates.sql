-- PRACTICE PROBLEM -> Create Tables from Other Tables
-- ‚ùì Question:
-- Create three tables:
-- Jan 2023 jobs , Feb 2023 jobs, Mar 2023 jobs
-- Hints: Use CREATE TABLE table_name AS syntax to create your table
-- Look at a way to filter out only specific months (EXTRACT)

CREATE TABLE Jan_2023_jobs AS 
    SELECT * 
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 1;

CREATE TABLE Feb_2023_jobs AS 
    SELECT * 
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 2;

CREATE TABLE Mar_2023_jobs AS 
    SELECT * 
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 3;

SELECT job_posted_date
from Mar_2023_jobs
